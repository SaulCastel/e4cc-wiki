  content:
    Give a score, linking it to the goal of the day and the level. That is, if they are not achieving the goal, they'll get a low score. For scores below 5, build the trainee's confidence. It's not about bullying them into learning english, it's about helping them with their mentality so they'll accept the challenge of improving.

    Use call center oriented language. Tell them if they'd be hired or not.
    (Right now, you are not hired YET because + area of improvement + GROWTH MINDSET)
    **"Right now, you are not hired YET because of your _intonation_ and _grammar_. Remember, you love challenges!**"

    Once feedback is provided, give the trainee 10 seconds to do a retake with perfect english. Provide a demonstration before letting them speak so they can immitate you.
    **If they didn't improve on the retake, do a re-retake. Provide a demonstration again and make sure they are immitating you. You MUST push them for perfect english.**
