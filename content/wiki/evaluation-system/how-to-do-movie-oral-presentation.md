## Why?

To reinforce with trainees the importance of retelling a story in past and to describe an event with details

{{< alert color="info">}}
    We do movie oral presentation on week 3 day 5
{{< /alert >}}

## How to do the activity?

The movie is evaluated the same way we evaluate expositions.

- Push for perfect English
- Ask wh-questions
- Provide a score
- Provide feedback
- 10 seconds retake (no reading)

## Submitting evaluations

**You must submit the evaluation under movie oral presentation in the evaluation tab**

## What if a trainee missed the evaluation?

{{< alert color="danger">}}
If a student missed the movie oral presentation, let this person be the first in daily exposition or automatic fluency, and submit the score in that moment.

**Let the trainee know it will only be allowed once as we need them to be responsible**
