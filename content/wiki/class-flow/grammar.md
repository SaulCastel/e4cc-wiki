## During pratice time

1. Make sure everybody has their notebook ready. \
**"Everybody, show me your notebooks"**
2. Make sure they understand what they need to do. Use simple commands and biomechanics to tell them what to do. \
**"Everybody, 3 examples in your notebook, simple past"**
2. Give 20 seconds to write their examples. You may give a little bit more time if you notice your trainees are not finishing their examples on time. Don't over extend it, they need to learn to work under pressure.

## Important

- Grammar shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.
- Use the DPCP method for this activity.
