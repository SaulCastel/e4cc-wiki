{{< alert color="info" >}}
Intermediate has interviews every friday.
{{< /alert >}}

## Tutorial
{{< youtube o4_mF1_SO6E >}}

## Submitting the evaluation score
Refer to the **Submitting evaluations"** section on {{< link "wiki/evaluation-system/how-to-do-next-level-evaluation/#submitting-evaluations">}}this article{{< /link >}} for considerations when submitting the evaluation.

## How many questions should I ask?
The only mandatory question you must ask each trainee is:
- Simple past ("Tell me about your favorite movie")

You continue with basic level questions:

- Simple present, 3rd person routine (ie. "What does your brother do every day?")
- Simple future (ie. "What are your plans for your next birthday?")

For the rest of the interview, ask intermediate level questions
- Modal verbs
- Conditionals
- Comparatives
- Superlatives
- Perfect tenses

**If a trainee has basic level mistakes, or they have already had too many mistakes, you can cut the interview short and skip the rest of the questions. Refer to the tutorial above.**
