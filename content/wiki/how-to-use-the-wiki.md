## Welcome to the E4CC wiki!

- Use the sidebar to look for content organized by category
- Use the search bar to search by keywords (Select it by pressing {{< kbd "ctrl" >}} + {{< kbd "/" >}} or just click on it)
    - For example, typing "book" will show the top 5 articles with that word either on its title or content
    - The result at the top is the one that your are most likely looking for

## Try the search bar!

Here are some examples of searches you can make
- _"How to take attedance"_ **or** _"attendance"_
- _"How to do DPCP"_ **or** _"DPCP"_ **or** _"dpcp"_
- _"How to do TPRS"_ **or** _"TPRS"_ **or** _"tprs"_
- _"How to give feedback"_ **or** _"feedback"_

**Searches are case insensitive. That means it won't distinguish between capital letters and lowercase letters.**

**The search bar is not a search engine. It doesn't understand natural language.**

It works by searching for matches in the title and content of articles.

Searching something like "How to do book quiz?" might show some results, but it's best to stick with keywords like "book", "book quiz", "quiz", "kahoot", etc.
