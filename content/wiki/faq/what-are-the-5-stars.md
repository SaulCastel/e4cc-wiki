The 5 stars refer to 5 key aspects of oral communication. These are important both for coaches and trainees.

- SMILE (Trainee smiles naturally while speaking)
- ENERGY (Trainee has proper posture, keeps eye contact and has good body language)
- INTONATION (Trainee speaks with melody, not flat)
- VOICE PROJECTION (Trainee speaks with the proper voice tone)
- FINAL SOUNDS (Trainee pronounces the final sounds of words)

## How to teach the 5 stars

**By example**

It's impossible for a trainee to improve on these areas if the coach doesn't lead by example. Your trainees will imitate anything and every thing you do. Be mindful of that.
